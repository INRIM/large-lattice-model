# large-lattice-model
A python package to model the motional spectra of atoms trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice.


## Requirements
Large-lattice-model requires the calculation of Mathieu special function.
The current `scipy` implementation of Mathieu functions [is not continuous.](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/14577)
It is reccomended to install the [GSL Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/), for example using:

    sudo apt install libgsl-dev

Large-lattice-model will use `ctypes` to import the GSL implementation and will fallback to `scipy` if it does not find GSL.
Previous versions of the package used [`pygsl`](https://github.com/pygsl/pygsl), but the current version of `pygsl` does not implement [special functions](https://github.com/pygsl/pygsl/issues/55).

It is developed for use in the INRIM Yb optical lattice clock IT-Yb1, see for example:
